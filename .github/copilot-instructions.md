# Augmented Coding Weekly LinkedIn Post Guidelines

When asked to create a LinkedIn post for an issue of Augmented Coding Weekly, follow this format:

## Structure
- Start with "ðŸ¤– Augmented Coding Weekly - Issue #[number]"
- Include 4 article highlights, each with:
  - An emoji relevant to the topic
  - A single sentence description focusing on the key insight or impact
  - The full URL to the original article
- End with "Read the full issue: https://augmentedcoding.dev/issue-[number]/"

## Tone and Style
- Hype-free and analytical
- Focus on implications and insights rather than just features
- Use professional but conversational language
- No hashtags
- Each description should be substantive and specific, not generic
- Don't use em-dashes, use commas instead

## Content Guidelines
- Extract the most thought-provoking or actionable insight from each article
- Highlight tensions, contradictions, or nuanced perspectives when present
- Include concrete details (e.g., "600 Reddit comments" not "community feedback")
- Connect tools/features to their broader impact on software development
