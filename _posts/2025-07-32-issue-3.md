## [AI Coding Agents Are Removing Programming Language Barriers](https://railsatscale.com/2025-07-19-ai-coding-agents-are-removing-programming-language-barriers/)

<small>RAILSATSCALE.COM</small>

I'm always interested in articles where experienced engineers share practical 'lived' examples of how AI has augmented their abilities, and this one is another great example. 

Stan is a career Ruby dev, with a decade of experience and a great depth of knowledge. Recently, for a variety of reasons, Stan has been pushed out of his comfort zone, having to pick up C, Rust and a host of low-level tasks. 

Stan reports that:

> The real breakthrough came when I stopped thinking of AI as a code generator and started treating it as a pairing partner with complementary skills.

They go on to describe a simple breakdown of how this pair programming work in practice. A really interesting read.

## [How Anthropic teams use Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/news/how-anthropic-teams-use-claude-code)

This case study is a little length, and it isn't much more than post-it note level notes. However, it is still interesting to hear from Anthropic, who tend to avoid the AI hype of their competitors. It's a good Smörgåsbord of ideas.
