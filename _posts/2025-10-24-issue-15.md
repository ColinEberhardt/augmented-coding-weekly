## [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills)

Much of the recent advances in LLM capability has been due to reasoning combined with tool-calling. Reasoning allows a model to 'think' through a problem step-by-step, whereas tool-calling allows the model to access external resources and APIs, for example searching the web or querying your local database. 

A year ago Anthropic launched [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), a standard for tool-calling, an integration pattern for connecting LLMs to APIs. However, with the release of Skills, I think they may have made MCP somewhat redundant.

Skills are deceptively simple, a markdown file with instructions, examples and code snippets. Anthropic used this feature to add document creation capabilities to Claude recently. Here's an [example skills that added PDF rendering capability](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/document-skills/pdf/SKILL.md).

So how is this different to MCP? In simple terms, MCP defines and documents external APIs, which models can navigate and invoke. Whereas, Skills are more of a recipe, describing how a model should solve a specific task via multiple steps. Importantly they rely on the model having access to an execution environment, a significant dependency, but if you've used Claude Code, or similar, you'll know just how much more powerful LLMs become when they can write and execute code and scripts.
