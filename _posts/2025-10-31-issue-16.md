## [AI can code, but it can't build software](https://bytesauna.com/post/coding-vs-software-engineering)

<small>BYTESAUNA.COM</small>

Matias is an experienced consultant who has recently experienced an uptick in queries from founders and CTOs along the lines of "I've vibe-coded an app, can you help me make it production-ready?". This has caused Matias to reflect on what LLMs can and cannot do, and why his services are still needed.

His pithy conclusion is that:

> "AI can code, but it can't build software"

Building software is more than just writing code, it requires architecting, engineering, making numerous decisions and appropriate compromises. 

AI is great at the first part, emitting code with astonishing speed, but it (currently) has little ability when it comes to the engineering side of software development.

## [Introducing vibe coding in Google AI Studio](https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-vibe-coding-in-google-ai-studio/)

<small>BLOG.GOOGLE</small>

Google's AI Studio is their recently launched one-stop-shop for all the developer-focussed AI tools and models, including Nano Banana, Gemini and Veo.

This blog post announces a new vibe-coding feature within the AI Studio:

> "This redesigned experience is meant to take you from prompt to working AI app in minutes"

I gave this feature a quick try, using it to build a clone of the [New York Times Connections game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections). Using simple prompting I was able to create a fully-functioning clone in just a few minutes.

This tool is very similar to [Bolt](https://bolt.new/), [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) and [v0](https://v0.app/), tools which I would [categorise as rapid prototyping tools](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2025/04/01/making-sense-of-the-ai-developer-tools-ecosystem.html). 

Their claim of prompt to working app in minutes definitely holds up. But as noted above, if you want a robust, production-ready app, vibe-coding isn't enough.
