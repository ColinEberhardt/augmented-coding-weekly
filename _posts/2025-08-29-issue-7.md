## [AI tooling must be disclosed for contributions](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/8289)

<small>GITHUB.COM</small>

Ghostty is a very popular terminal emulator, with around 35k stars on GitHub. This recently documentation update adds a requirement that if you use any form of AI assistance in contributing to the project, this must be detailed and disclosed in your pull request.

The reason for this disclosure is as follows:

> "In a perfect world, AI assistance would produce equal or higher quality work than any human. That isn't the world we live in today, and in most cases it's generating slop. I say this despite being a fan of and using them successfully myself (with heavy supervision)!"

It's frustrating that a popular open source project has to make this mandate, however, this isn't the first time I've heard of open source maintainers struggling with an increase of "AI Slop". Daniel Stenberg, maintainer of curl and open source rockstar, [recently shared](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielstenberg_hackerone-curl-activity-7324820893862363136-glb1/) that he is being overwhelmed by poor quality contributions and CVE reports.  

Unfortunately AI does make it all too easy to create large quantities of poor quality content and code.
