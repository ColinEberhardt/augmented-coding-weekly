## [Do things that don’t scale, and then don’t scale](https://derwiki.medium.com/do-things-that-dont-scale-and-then-don-t-scale-9fd2cd7e2156)

The phrase "Do things that don't scale" was coined by Paul Graham, of Y Combinator fame, as a guiding mantra for startups. In the early stages of development, don't worry about scaling - just get your product into user's hands as quickly as possible. In other words, find the quickest way to validate your idea. You can work out how to scale later (if it is a success).

This blog post is a playful twist on the same concept, with AI augmented development and vibe coding it is now much easier to build things just for yourself. Things that you never need to scale, simply because the only user is _you_.

I've found myself doing this quite a bit, building personal apps, and experimenting, now that I can move more quickly. And you know what? It's fun!
