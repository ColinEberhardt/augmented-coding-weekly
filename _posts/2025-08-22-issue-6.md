## [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/)

<small>AGENTS.MD</small>

OpenAI (and friends) have created a "simple, open format for guiding coding agents", called `AGENTS.md` - I've got mixed feelings about this initiative. In essence, it is nothing more than a text file that certain agents will add to their context. It isn't a specification, or file format. It is just a filename. The website really doesn't make this clear, implying it is something more sophisticated.

I'm not convinced of the value of having a separate `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`. LLMs are great at consuming content designed for humans, having separate guidance for agents and humans complicates matters. 

The hierarchic support is weak, with the agent just using the `AGENTS.md` file from the closest folder, as a result, guidance needs to be duplicated across agen files. It would be trivial to supply an agent with multiple `AGENTS.md` files in priority order.

In brief `AGENTS.md` files are little more than a `README.md` file with enough hype to motivate people to create one. Are people more motivated to write documentation for machines than for humans?

## [Do things that don’t scale, and then don’t scale](https://derwiki.medium.com/do-things-that-dont-scale-and-then-don-t-scale-9fd2cd7e2156)

The phrase "Do things that don't scale" was coined by Paul Graham, of Y Combinator fame, as a guiding mantra for startups. In the early stages of development, don't worry about scaling - just get your product into user's hands as quickly as possible. In other words, find the quickest way to validate your idea. You can work out how to scale later (if it is a success).

This blog post is a playful twist on the same concept, with AI augmented development and vibe coding it is now much easier to build things just for yourself. Things that you never need to scale, simply because the only user is _you_.

I've found myself doing this quite a bit, building personal apps, and experimenting, now that I can move more quickly. And you know what? It's fun!
