... on the the myriad ways to use AI agents

The industry direction of travel is moving away from AI augmenting our existing engineering practices, to the agentic model, where tools like Claude Code have autonomy, with the human operator taking on the higher-level roles of project manager, designer, and software architect.

However, these AI agents are not effective 'out of the box'. This blog post argues that you should treat these tools as a framework, a set of rules, guidance, and ultimately choices which you need to make.

This blog post does a really good job of outlining some of the framework decisions you need to make, and how some well-known agentic frameworks reflect these different choices.

If you are jumping into agentic software development, this is a worth a read.
