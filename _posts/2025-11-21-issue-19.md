## [How AI will change software engineering – with Martin Fowler](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/martin-fowler)

<small>PRAGMATICENGINEER.COM</small>

In the latest issue of The Pragmatic Engineer, Gergely interviews Martin Fowler, a highly experienced and wise engineer. Martin has lived through many significant advances in our industry, from assembler to high-level languages and the creation of the Agile Manifesto, where he was a co-author. 

Martin feels that LLMs, and AI augmented software development, is the biggest transformation he's experienced in his lifetime. But don't mistake this statement for hype - in this interview Martin considers the impacts with wisdom and pragmatism.

They discuss vibe coding, which Martin feels is a great tool for experimentation, but not production use. On specification driven development, he considers this a useful tool for better defining the task an LLM should undertake, but that the code is still an important artifact that needs to be crafted and understood.

Over the course of almost two hours they cover a host of other topics. Well worth a listen.
