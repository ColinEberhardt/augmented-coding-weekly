## [Claude Code On-the-go](https://granda.org/en/2026/01/02/claude-code-on-the-go/)

The smartphone is an amazing productivity device, supporting small tasks such as checking emails, but also those that are more involved, such as drafting documents. However, despite its ever-growing power, very few people use smartphones for programming. They lack the screen real-estate, the runtime environment and don't have a terribly good input device (on-screen keyboards are terrible for programming).

With AI agents, this could be about to change. I've seen a growing number of people describing how they have conversations with their AI chatbot or agent of choice, giving it problems to solve, or project briefs, then leaving it to work away on the problem while the do something else instead. 

This blog post describes how to run multiple agents in parallel from a phone. The post itself is pretty technical, so unless you're looking to create this setup you might want to gloss over the details.

Technical detail aside, it is interesting to see how AI agents are reshaping not just how we build software but where we are when we're building it!
