## [The rise of industrial software](https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/12/30/the-rise-of-industrial-software)

AI agents can write code far faster than any human being and as a result the cost of code production has dropped significantly (yes, I know, AI generated code still has quality issues). This blog post asks the question "What happens to software when its production undergoes an industrial revolution?"

When processes become automated and industrialised it significantly reduces the barrier to entry, we have seen that already with the rise of vibe coding. A second order effect of  industrialisation is often high-volume production of low-quality goods, in other words, we'll see a lot of vibe coded disposable software.

> "the feedback loops of novelty and reward will drive an explosion of software output that makes the past half-century of development look quaint by comparison"

So what does this mean for traditional, hand-crafted software? There is still a place for human creativity, Research and Development and high-value innovation, but we should expect this to more rapidly become industrialised in future, creating a faster flywheel.

A fascinating post.

As an aside, I do think there are some notable flaws in the logic. Industrial processes reduce the marginal costs of undertaking repeatable units of work (i.e. each car that exits the assembly line is the same as the last). While each software product is somewhat unique, there are a lot of repeatable processes and common components 'under the hood'.

The smartphone is an amazing productivity device, supporting small tasks such as checking emails, but also those that are more involved, such as drafting documents. However, despite its ever-growing power, very few people use smartphones for programming. They lack the screen real-estate, the runtime environment and don't have a terribly good input device (on-screen keyboards are terrible for programming).

With AI agents, this could be about to change. I've seen a growing number of people describing how they have conversations with their AI chatbot or agent of choice, giving it problems to solve, or project briefs, then leaving it to work away on the problem while the do something else instead. 

This blog post describes how to run multiple agents in parallel from a phone. The post itself is pretty technical, so unless you're looking to create this setup you might want to gloss over the details.

Technical detail aside, it is interesting to see how AI agents are reshaping not just how we build software but where we are when we're building it!
