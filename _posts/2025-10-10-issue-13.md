## [Building Apps in Real Time: My Experience with Claude Imagine](https://medium.com/@meshuggah22/building-apps-in-real-time-my-experience-with-claude-imagine-f4296cb2c812)

In [last week's newsletter](https://augmentedcoding.dev/issue-12/) I covered the Sonnet 4.5 release, Anthropics flagship model that hopes to regain its crown from GPT-5. There was something interesting lurking at the bottom of their release blog post, a bonus research preview, of "Imagine with Claude". 

This limited time demo, for Pro and Max subscribers, is a prompt-to-prototype tool. We already have these of course, with [Bolt](https://bolt.new/) and [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) being notable leaders. However, where other prototyping tools still have an embedded editor, Imagine entirely does away with the IDE. They are relying on the speed and power of their model to be able to create working software right before your eyes.

As Pawel notes in this post:

> "The line between designer, developer, and user starts to blur. You’re simultaneously describing what you want, seeing it built, testing it, and refining it — all in the same conversation."
