## [Introducing Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5)

<small>ANTHROPIC.COM</small>

 - Anthropic positions Sonnet 4.5 as “the best coding model,” citing strong gains on coding, reasoning, math, finance, and “computer use” (OS interaction).
 - Upgrades to Claude Code: an Agent SDK (tools/permissions/context mgmt), revamped terminal, new VS Code extension, and checkpoints to instantly undo changes.
 - Competitive or leading on coding-centric leaderboards; notable speed and cost efficiency vs peers.
 - Big jump in “computer use” scores, suggesting better tool orchestration and parallel tool calls.
 - Early reactions: Mixed but generally positive: some users see modest improvement over 4.0; others report clear gains in instruction-following, parallel tool use, speed, and value.
 - Several note GPT-5 (Code/“codecs”) still leads in “deep reasoning” on tough, long-context problems; Sonnet praised for fast, “light reasoning” and surgical edits.
 - Agentic coding teams (e.g., Devon/Cognition, Factory) report higher reliability, faster multi-hour sessions, better planning, and context-window awareness (with occasional “context anxiety” trade-offs).
 - Imagine with Claude: “model-as-backend” that generates UI and behavior on the fly—early, imperfect, but hints at personalized, ephemeral apps.
 - Anthropic says Sonnet 4.5 ran ~30 hours autonomously to build a Slack-like app (~11k LOC), far exceeding prior run-length reports—if reproducible, a notable shift in the autonomy frontier.
 - Sonnet 4.5 looks like a fast, cost-effective coding workhorse with stronger tool use and OS control. For hardest reasoning tasks, many still prefer GPT-5; optimal workflows likely involve model-switching by task.

## [How Claude Code is built](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-claude-code-is-built)

<small>PRAGMATICENGINEER.COM</small>

Here’s a super-brief bullet summary of *“How Claude Code is built”*:

* Claude Code grew from a simple terminal prototype that could interact with the filesystem and evolved into a full internal tool. 
* The stack is TypeScript + React + Ink + Yoga + Bun, chosen because Claude models are already strong in those “on-distribution” technologies. 
* Around **90% of Claude Code’s own code** is generated by Claude itself. 
* The tool architecture is minimal: the model handles most logic (UI, file traversal, tool use), and the client layer stays lightweight. 
* It runs **locally**, not in a sandbox or VM; permissions are granted interactively by the user before changes. 
* The permissions system is multi-tiered (project / user / company), with whitelisting and command analysis. 
* Feature development is extremely fast: dozens of internal releases per day, ~1 external release per day, and heavy prototyping (e.g. ~20 variants in 2 days) 
* Terminal UX is reimagined: dynamic interactions, to-do list UI elements, toggleable displays, etc. 
* “AI-first engineering” practices: using agents for code reviews, test automation, feature flags, tightly integrating model feedback into dev workflows. 
* The article suggests Claude Code is a model for how future fast-moving, AI-augmented engineering teams might operate. 

## [The RAG Obituary: Killed by Agents, Buried by Context Windows](https://www.nicolasbustamante.com/p/the-rag-obituary-killed-by-agents)

<small>NICOLASBUSTAMANTE.COM</small>

* Bustamante argues that **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is becoming obsolete as context windows grow and agentic systems mature. 
* Traditional RAG pipelines suffer from cascading failure modes (chunking, embedding, reranking, hybrid search complexity) and high infrastructure costs. 
* Claude Code is presented as a countermodel: instead of retrieval + embedding, it uses file system tools (grep, glob) plus agents to navigate code directly, avoiding chunking/embedding/reranking entirely. 
* In the new “context-rich” era, agents that can reason across large documents and maintain end-to-end context will supersede retrieval systems; RAG becomes a fallback rather than the core. 

## [Announcing fossabot: AI Agent for Strategic Dependency Updates](https://fossa.com/blog/fossabot-dependency-upgrade-ai-agent/)

<small>FOSSA.COM</small>

Software dependencies have become increasingly complex, with a trend towards having a high number of small dependencies. This makes managing dependency updates quite challenging.

Tools like dependabot, which are supposed to help manage this, by bringing upstream changes into your repository sound like a good idea, but in practice, result in a lot of noise and work (for the maintainers).

This new agent looks like a promising tool to alleviate this burden. The agent performs an analysis of the upstream change and the impact it has on your project. This context specific information should help determine whether it is worth spending the effort on the update.

Ultimately this could help reduce supply chain attacks, which often rely on the above issue resulting in complacency.
