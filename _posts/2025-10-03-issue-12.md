## [Introducing Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5)

<small>ANTHROPIC.COM</small>

 - Anthropic positions Sonnet 4.5 as “the best coding model,” citing strong gains on coding, reasoning, math, finance, and “computer use” (OS interaction).
 - Upgrades to Claude Code: an Agent SDK (tools/permissions/context mgmt), revamped terminal, new VS Code extension, and checkpoints to instantly undo changes.
 - Competitive or leading on coding-centric leaderboards; notable speed and cost efficiency vs peers.
 - Big jump in “computer use” scores, suggesting better tool orchestration and parallel tool calls.
 - Early reactions: Mixed but generally positive: some users see modest improvement over 4.0; others report clear gains in instruction-following, parallel tool use, speed, and value.
 - Several note GPT-5 (Code/“codecs”) still leads in “deep reasoning” on tough, long-context problems; Sonnet praised for fast, “light reasoning” and surgical edits.
 - Agentic coding teams (e.g., Devon/Cognition, Factory) report higher reliability, faster multi-hour sessions, better planning, and context-window awareness (with occasional “context anxiety” trade-offs).
 - Imagine with Claude: “model-as-backend” that generates UI and behavior on the fly—early, imperfect, but hints at personalized, ephemeral apps.
 - Anthropic says Sonnet 4.5 ran ~30 hours autonomously to build a Slack-like app (~11k LOC), far exceeding prior run-length reports—if reproducible, a notable shift in the autonomy frontier.
 - Sonnet 4.5 looks like a fast, cost-effective coding workhorse with stronger tool use and OS control. For hardest reasoning tasks, many still prefer GPT-5; optimal workflows likely involve model-switching by task.
