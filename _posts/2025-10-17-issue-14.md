## [Daily Install Trends of AI Coding Tools](https://bloomberry.com/coding-tools.html)

<small>BLOOMBERRY.COM</small>

This website tracks the popularity of various AI tools based on the daily install counts from the VSCode Marketplace. This is of course going to be skewed towards tools that exist within the VSCode ecosystem, missing tools like Cursor, or the usage of a given tool as a standalone application (e.g. Claude Code).

However, we do see some interesting trends emerge. GitHup Copilot dominates (which is no great surprise), interestingly, the rate of adoption is accelerating as indicated by the sharper climb in install numbers over the past few months.

Startups in this space like Cline and Augment Code had early spikes, but it looks like they're quickly decelerating in popularity too. It will be interesting to see how newer entrants like Codex fair over time. 

## [Augment Code: 22.5% of our users are consuming 20x what they're currently paying](https://old.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1o60nlz/addressing_community_feedback_on_our_new_pricing/)

On the subject of AI tooling startups ... Augment Code were something of a leader, having built up quite a following. However, news of a significant pricing change which they [announced a couple of weeks ago](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/augment-codes-pricing-is-changing), has had a very negative impact on the community that they have been fostering, hence their need to provide more transparency in this Reddit post.

Unfortunately they have suffered from a generous slug of VC funding which has allowed them to operate their platform at a significant lost, at least for some of their user demographic. As a result, they've had to take some radical steps to try and better align the end-user usage with the price they are paying for this service.

I do still wonder what the different is between the fees users are paying and the costs incurred in delivering this service? I'd be willing to bet that even with this pricing reset they are still going to be making a loss.
