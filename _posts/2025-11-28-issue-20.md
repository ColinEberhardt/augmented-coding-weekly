## [Building an AI-Native Engineering Team](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/build-ai-native-engineering-team/)

<small>OPENAI.COM</small>

AI augmented software development is much more than just writing code faster, it is about transforming the way that we approach the craft of software development itself.

Unfortunately this topic of conversation often veers into hype-fuelled nonsense!

I'm please to see OpenAI publishing a guide that looks at the full software lifecycle (Plan, Design, Build, ... Maintain), considering the impact agentic AI has and what Engineers now "do instead". This is a very practical way of looking at the transformative effects of AI.

Considering that OpenAI are a product company that sells AI Agents, there is a bit of overreach in some of their statements around what these coding agents are truly capable of, but the overall framework makes a lot of sense.
